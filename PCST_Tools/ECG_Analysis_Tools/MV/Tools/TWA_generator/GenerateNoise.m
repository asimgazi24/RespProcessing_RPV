function [noise] = GenerateNoise(noisetype,SignalPower,SNR,N,varargin)
%
% noise =  GenerateNoise(noisetype,SignalPower,SNR,N,Param1,Param2,...),
% ECG noise generator
%
% Usage:
%       WN =  GenerateNoise(0,SignalPower,SNR,N,seed);
%       CN =  GenerateNoise(1,SignalPower,SNR,N,fs,beta,seed);
%       MX =  GenerateNoise(2,SignalPower,SNR,N,fs,[w_bw,w_em,w_ma],seed);
%
% inputs:
% noisetype
%       0:     white noise (WN)
%       1:     colored noise (CN)
%       2:     mixture of real baseline wander, electrode movements, muscle artifacts (MX)
% 
% SignalPower: The desired signal power. set to mean(x.^2) for the data vector x
% SNR: The desired SNR
% N: Number of samples
% fs: Sampling frequency required for noisetype = 1,2
% beta: Noise coloring factor required for noisetype = 1. beta = 0 (white noise),
%       beta = 1 (pink noise), beta = 2 (brown noise or random walk)
% seed(optional): Random seed for the noise vector. For noisetype =
%       2 seed is the initial random starting point in the real recorded
%       noises
% [w_bw,w_em,w_ma](optional): The weighting factors of BW, EM, and MA noise (only for noisetype = 2).
%
% output:
% noise: Column vector of noise
