function [beat_matrix, avg_even, avg_odd] = CalcBeat_Matrix(fid, validleads, STLen, valid, TWARes, ecg)

% OVERVIEW This function calculates the alternans series for different points within st segment.
% If a given beat is marked as invalid it's replaced by the average even/odd beat
%
% INPUT:    MANDATORY       DESCRIPTION
%           ecg             (num_of_samples x num_of_leads)
%           fid             (1 x num_of_beats)
%           amp             (num_of_beats x num_of_leads)
%           STLen (scaler)  length of the S-Tend segment
%           valid           (1 x num_of_beats)
% OUTPUT:
%           beat_matrix     (num_of_timepoints x num_of_beats x num_of_leads): aligned ecg beats matrix
%           avg_even        (num_of_timepoints x num_of_leads) average even S-T offset beat
%           avg_odd         (num_of_timepoints x num_of_leads) average odd S-T offset beat.
