% OUTPUTS       
%
%               res                 flag which indicates if script evaluated
%                                   successfully, 1 indicates parameters were succesfully set.

%               Param               A structure which contains the different paramters set, used in measuring TWAs.
%                                   Contains the following fields,     
%               .NumRuns            Perform 100 reshuffles to estimate gamma distribution for noise in T wave amplitude series.
%               .MethodForEctopy    Missing or abnormal beats are to be replaced with the average even or odd beat.
%               .Alignment          Specify alignment is to be performed over S-T offset interval.
%               .corrQRS            Correlation threshold with QRS template to determine clean QRS complex in beat
%               .corrT              Correlation threshold with S-T offset template to determine clean S-T segment in beat.
%               .Interval           Beats, window of analysis for the MMA.
%               .simple             If simple == true, odd and even average beats are just that - standard average beats.
%               .threshold          Confidence interval for significance.
