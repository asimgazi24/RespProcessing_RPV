%function [TWARes.VAlt, TWARes.VAlt_Sig, TWARes.noise_median, TWARes.noise_95, TWARes.VAltPt, TWARes.threshold, HR] = Analyze_TWA_segment(ECG, Fs, ann)
function [TWARes] = Analyze_TWA_segment(ECG, Fs, ann)
% OVERVIEW, This function loads the parameters used for analysis in the Param structure, lowpass Filters the ecg and for power line interference if needed.
% It then calls the TWA_analyze script used for analyzing the ecg.

% INPUTS        MANDATORY       DESCRIPTION
%               ECG             N by M array of ECG data, with M channels
%                               and N datapoints in each channel.
%
%               Fs              Sampling frequency for the ecg, needs to
%                               1000 Hz.
%
%               ann             annotations for the ecg as structure
%                               variable. The variable contains the Q,R<S<T
%                               fiducial points.
