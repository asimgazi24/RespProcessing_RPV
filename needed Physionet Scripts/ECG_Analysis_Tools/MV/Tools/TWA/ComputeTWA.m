function [TWAresult] = ComputeTWA(ecg,ann,fs)
%OVERVIEW, This is main function which calls the Analyze_TWA_segment function
% which measures TWA using the statistical reshuffling method.
%
% INPUT:        MANDATORY:      DESCRIPTION:
%               ecg             N by M (row by col) array of ecg data with each of M columns corresponding to a single channel of ecg.
%                               Each channel has N datapoints.
%
%               ann             the annotations structure contains Q,R,S,T
%                               fiducial points.
